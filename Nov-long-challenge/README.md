My first long challenge on CodeChef.

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to November long challenge problems from https://codechef.com. I have not stopped my practice yet so I am going to keep adding new ones.

I used C++ whenever possible and submitted with 32-bit GNU C++ 17 compiler.
